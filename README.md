# Simple JAVA Code
## Description
This repository contains basic Java programs written for practice and demonstration purposes. The programs include simple logic implementations and can be useful for beginners learning Java.


## Technology I used
- Java (Core Java)

## Prerequisites
Before running the tests, ensure you have:
- Java (JDK 17) installed

## How to run?
- ### Clone the Repository
     - ```git clone https://github.com/Labonno0987/Simple-JAVA-Code```
     - ```cd Simple-JAVA-Code ```
       
- ### Running the Code for Each Problem
  - Each problem is a separate Java class file under the src/main/java directory of the project. To run the code for a specific problem:
    #### For Example of Finding the 2nd Highest CGPA:
      - Navigate to the FindSecondHighestCGPA.java file located under src/main/java.
      - Open it in your IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
      - Right-click on the file and select Run 'FindSecondHighestCGPA' to execute the program.
      - The program will ask for input and provide the solution for the task.
      - For Problem 2, navigate to FindCGPA.java, and so on for each of the 15 problems.
